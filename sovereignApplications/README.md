# Confidential sample application for Sovereign Landing Zone

The confidential sample application is described [here](../sovereignApplications/confidential/hrAppWorkload/README.md). There are two parts of the application: 
* Confidential services which represent the main part of the app
* Non-confidential services which are auxilary parts, like [admin VM](./nonConfidential/adminVM/README.md) and [storage account](./nonConfidential/storageAccount/README.md)
