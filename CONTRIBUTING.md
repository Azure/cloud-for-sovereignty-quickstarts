# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot automatically determines whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the pull request appropriately (for example, status check, comment). Follow the instructions provided by the bot. You need to do this step once across all repos using our CLA.
